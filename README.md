# Energy Anomaly Detection using GRU and GRU-Autoencoder

This repository contains a reproduction and extension of a two-step anomaly detection pipeline for household energy data:
1) GRU-based forecaster
2) GRU-based autoencoder using reconstruction error

The project uses the Individual Household Electric Power Consumption dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Contents
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebook with full experiment pipeline
- `paper/` – LaTeX source, submitted PDF, and submission proof
- `figures/` – All plots used in the paper

## How to run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload `household_power_consumption.txt`
3. Run cells from top to bottom

## Dataset
UCI ML Repository:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption  
(The dataset is not included in this repository.)
